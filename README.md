  The challenge was to the best of my current ability, using Flexbox, to recreate the website www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/ ! I recently had done a very needed upgrade to my computer, and thought this would be a cool way to show my flexbox capabilities using this site!

## How Its Made

**Languages used:** Html and CSS

### Html

### CSS

## Styling Effects
