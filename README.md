  The challenge was to the best of my current ability, using Flexbox, to recreate the website Nvidia.com/geforce! I recently had done a very much needed upgrade to my computer, and wanted to show my capabilities using this site!

## How Its Made

**Languages used:** Html and CSS

### Html
With the html, I worked with more lists and links. I did not go with `button element`, but styled and customized the buttons. Organized and neat, I prefer to keep my Html this way. Personally, I need to work on class and id names for specificity. 

### CSS
For this project, I went with `Flexbox` and learned a lot. It was fun to use and it gave me the required styling without having to add more lines of code. I made 2 separate CSS files to hold my style and the 2nd to hold my effects. 

## Styling Effects

I added styling and effects for the navigation bar, buttons and the link icons. I added the GeForce Font style to make the site look like its original.

Learned about select menus and options. I learned how to style them and create custom select menus.

Learned about the appearance property and its different options based on the browser.
